Summary from latest sim (250 games)
- Wins: P1=97 (38.8%), P2=153 (61.2%), TO=0
- Hit rate: P1=0.037, P2=0.107; K/D: P1=0.336, P2=2.977
- Wasted attack rate: P1≈0.992, P2≈0.920
- Progress (net toward finish): P1=6578, P2=6370; Token pickups (move): P1=376, P2=327

Interpretation
- Clear Player-2 advantage driven by much higher hit rate and K/D. P2 converts attacks far better and wastes fewer.
- First-player was fixed to P1 in this run, so initiative alone does not explain the bias; likely sources are P2-native heuristics and mirror-side handling.

Next focus
- Normalize starter fairness: alternate initiative by match and by round so both sides get equal first picks and first reveals over time.
- Then revisit aggregator/summary to reflect true initiative counts and continue tuning P1 attack selection and buff spend on last actions.
