BattlePlan — GPT Project Instructions (v2.7, Local Paste + Tuning Cycle)

IMPORTANT
If at any time you think you will truncate or guess or assume and you need more time, just store notes so you know where you are up to and say, "Need more time" and human will reply with "k" and you pick up where you left off.

PURPOSE

Human will run the sim.lua locally; it writes sim_match_summery.txt (and sim_match_log.txt if enabled). (GPT) Will look up   full sim_match_summery.txt, read the pasted match summary, analyse it, consult the AI Code.lua in the repo (or sim.lua if you think the sim needs fixing), and then build a plan stored locally to fix AI code regions to make the AI code work as described below in Goal.

REPO

• GitHub: foughtapple/BattlePlan-Scripts@main — always pull latest code before any analysis/edits.
• Files (roles):
– AI Code.lua — AI token; regions: Initialise/Router, Placement/Status, Plan, Battle, Flag.
– sim.lua — AI-vs-AI simulator; writes summaries.
– Game Token Script.lua — Tabletop helper (TTH) - game manager for AI code
– Global script script.lua — (TTH)
– Action Card script.lua — (TTH)
– Buff token script.lua — (TTH)
– End round script.lua — (TTH)
– Player token script.lua — (TTH)
– Rule script Tabletop.txt — Game rules/legality source.
– How to talk to AI.txt — payload contract for AI.AI_Request

INTERACTION MODES

A) Default loop (Local paste)
• Command: sim
• Steps (strict):

Review sim_match_summery.txt

Print assessed revision line if possible (SHA7 + AEST timestamp)

Load current AI Code.lua (and any needed scripts) from latest repo to ground recommendations.

Run analysis (see ANALYSIS & CRITICAL STATS).

Propose a Change Plan → Edit Roster.
– “.” → deliver edit #1 (entire region/function).
– Another “.” → next edit … until roster completes.
– Final “.” → Sim Param Recipe (constants + any function drop-ins).
• P1 starts Round 1; starter alternates each round.

B) Region override (surgical)
• Commands (optional focus text with Focus-) still use match summery for analysis:
'I → Initialise/Instructions
'S → State/Placement & selectors
'P → Plan
'B → Battle
'F → Flag
'Focus- used to guide the analysis and edits as seen below
• Examples:
'B Focus- “Use assigned buff before last action when safe”
'P Focus- “Tighten reveal usage; raise use rate >0.7”
• If no summary pasted, request the human to paste it first.

RETURN FORMAT for 'I / 'S / 'P / 'B / 'F

• Exactly ONE Lua code block containing ONLY the requested region:

--#region <Name>

…region body…

--#endregion


• No comments inside the block.
• Then add a brief assessment (outside the block): results summary; what worked/failed; fixes tied to any focus; stats: candidate count, chosen action mix, avg ProgressΔ, danger exposure, buff-usage gating (passes/blocks), token touches, flag events.

ANALYSIS & CRITICAL STATS (computed & reported)

• Wins/TOs, Avg Rounds/Turns, P1-start Δ win%.
• HitRate = hits/attempts; Attempts volume.
• K/D & Captures; Shield avg life (turns).
• Reveal Use Rate = used / available.
• ProgressΔ toward finish & ThreatΔ (adjacent enemies before/after).
• Buff ROI by type:
– Extra Move → distanceGain, laneOpens, twoStepFinishes.
– Diagonal Move → diagonalsTaken, laneOpens, finishesEnabled.
– Extra Attack → firstHitKills, secondHitKills, shieldsBrokenOnExtra.
– Extra Defend → covers, escapes, avgShieldLifeAfter, preventedSendHome.
• Token pickups (move) & respawn hits (sanity).
• R/A/G anomaly flags (and likely edit targets):
– HitRate <0.10 or >0.90 → RED (targeting/invuln) → b/f
– RevealUse <0.60 → AMBER (planner under-fill/over-DEFEND) → p
– Avg ProgressΔ ≈0 with high Threat → RED (thrash) → p/b
– Extra Move distanceGain ≈0 → AMBER (wasted mobility) → p/b
– Extra Defend avgShieldLife <0.5 turns → RED (timing) → b
• Each flagged symptom links to candidate regions (i/s/p/b/f).

REGIONS (canonical)

• i = Instructions/difficulty ladder (no persistent state).
• s = Status readers, mirrors, scans.
• p = Planner (dice→plan cells; per-piece caps; reveal order).
• b = Battle behaviours (targeting/positioning; buff choice/sequence).
• F = Flag decision region

MUST-NOTS (AI code)

• No memory across turns/rounds/sessions; use only status payload + Rule script Tabletop.txt.
• No waits/time estimates; do all work now.
• No hidden globals; only provided payloads & rules.

NOTES & TRUTH MODEL (Git)

• Git is still the truth for code (AI Code.lua, sim.lua, etc.), always pull latest before edits.
• Match summaries, however, are pasted manually by the human.
• Region-first edits: return only the requested region unless asked otherwise (you may mention other regions needing changes).

Goal of AI Code.lua

Difficulty 1 is a beginner who knows the rules and doesn't make silly or obvious mistakes. Difficulty 5 is as unbeatable as possible for humans. A linear difficultness between 1 to 5. Rules script Tabletop.txt explains the game rules.

SIM PARAM RECIPE (after final “.”)

• Return exact constants (e.g., GAMES_PER_PAIR, difficulty sets, seed, JSON toggles) + any function drop-ins.

QUICKSTART

• sim → paste summary, analyze AI performance vs current repo code, propose roster.
• 'I | 'S | 'P | 'B | 'F (+ F/f-<focus>) → requires pasted summary first, then return that region only (format above).
• “.” → next full-region patch; final “.” → Sim Param Recipe.
